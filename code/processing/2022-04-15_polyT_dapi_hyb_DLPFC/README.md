# 2022-04-15 polyT/dapi hybridization of post-mortem human DLPFC tissue

## Purpose
This experiment used the Cai lab protocol for polyT hybridization to perform polyT and dapi hybridization on DLPFC post-mortem slices. The purpose of this experiment is to ensure that this protocol works. <fill in> 

## Materials
- humid chambeer = an empty pipette tip box, with a damp tissue in the bottom section & a lid
- poly-lysine derivatived slides (see protocol)
- EtoH
- 1X PBS
- 4% PFA in 1X PBS
- 8% SDS in 1X PBS
- DAPI
- 10% Wash Buffer: 
- 
  

Slide: E8947111, cut on 4/12/22 to dry overnight, DLPFC post-mortem brain slice 

## Notes and Observations
The reagents were several years old and we suspected that they might not work.

## Summary of Results
We did not see the expected staining results - the nuclei were not stained blue as expected, but were a faint brown.

## Experimental Protocol
  
*Complete steps 1-4 vertically in a glass coplin staining dish, then the rest horizontally in a humid chamber*
1. Obtain poly-lysine derivatized cover slips from Anthony/Jina (Cai lab). Bring coverslip to room temperature, section tissue, and mount on coverslips.
2. Place slide in 4% PFA in 1X PBS at room temperature for 10 minutes.
3. Wash slide twice with 1X PBS for 1 minute each.
4. Wash slide in 70% EtOH at room temperature for 30 minutes. Remove from ethanol and air dry.
5. Permeabilize in 8% SDS in PBS at room temperature for 30 minutes. Complete this step lying flat with 1 mL on slide in humid chamber. 
6. Remove SDS with pipette. 
7. Dip slide gently in 70% EtOH for 2 - 3 times, then air dry. *Note: do this gently otherwise the tissue section might come off the slide*
8. Rehydrate with 1 mL 2X SSC lying flat for 5 minutes at room temperature. 
9. Remove 2X SSC  add 100 uL of probe solution. 
10. Incubate with probe solution for 22.5 minutes.
11. Remove probe solution then add 10% wash buffer for 7.5 minutes at room temperature. 
12. Remove wash buffer and rinse with 2X SSC. 
13. Remove 2X SSC then incubate in 2X SSC + 1:1000 DAPI for 1 minute.
14. Remove DAPI then wash with 2X SSC twice.
15. Add equilibration buffer 300 uL for 2 minutes then drain.
16. Mount in 50 uL slo-fade anti-bleaching solution.
17. Cover with coverslip and seal with nail polish.
