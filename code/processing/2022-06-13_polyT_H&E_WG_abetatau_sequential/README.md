# 2022-06-13 PolyT/dapi, H&E, wright giemmsa, and abeta/tau staining of post-mortem human DLPFC tissue

## Purpose
The goals of this experiment are:
1. To scale up the sequential polyT/dapi and H&E dataset for the stain translation machine learning project. 
2. To try the wright giemmsa stain in the sequential format (i.e. polyT/dapi hybridization -> wright giemmsa)
3. To try adding a-beta and tau antibody staining to the polyT/dapi and H&E sequential staining. 

## Materials

Staining & Imaging: 
Slide: 3453102, slice #1-4 cut on 6/10/22 and stored in freezer for 3 days, DLPFC post-mortem cogdx 1 brain slice
Slide: 4781406, slice #1-4 cut on 6/10/22 and stored in freezer for 3 days, DLPFC post-mortem cogdx 4 brain slice

## Experimental Protocol

| Slide # |       Stain        | 
| ------- | ------------------ |
|    1    | only wright giemmsa|
|    2    | sequential polyT/dapi -> abeta/tau antibody -> H&E |
|    3    | sequential polyT/dapi -> wright giemmsa |
|    4    | sequential polyT/dapi -> H&E |

For slides # 2 - 4: (completeed on June 13, 2022)

1. Delipidize sections overnight in 1:1 100% EtOH:CHCl3
2. Place slide for 3 mins in 95% EtOH, 3 mins in 70% EtOH, and 3 min in dH20. 
3. Apply adequate Hematoxylin, Mayer’s (Lillie’s Modification) to completely cover 
tissue section and incubate for 5 mins.
4. Rinse slide in two changes of distilled water (1 min each) to remove excess stain.
5. Apply adequate Bluing Reagent to completely cover tissue section and incubate for
15 secs.
6. Rinse slide in two changes of distilled water (1 min each).
7. Dip slide in absolute alcohol and blot excess off.
8. Apply adequate Eosin Y Solution (Modified Alcoholic) to completely cover tissue
section to excess and incubate for 2-3 mins.
9. Rinse slide using absolute alcohol (quick).
10. Dehydrate slide in three changes of absolute alcohol (3 min each).
11. Clear slide with two changes in xylene (5 min each).

For slides
13. Blot excess and mount in synthetic resin
