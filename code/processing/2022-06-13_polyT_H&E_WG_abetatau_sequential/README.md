# 2022-06-13 PolyT/dapi, H&E, wright giemmsa, and abeta/tau staining of post-mortem human DLPFC tissue

## Purpose
The goals of this experiment are:
1. To scale up the sequential polyT/dapi and H&E dataset for the stain translation machine learning project. 
2. To try the wright giemmsa stain in the sequential format (i.e. polyT/dapi hybridization -> wright giemmsa)
3. To try adding a-beta and tau antibody staining to the polyT/dapi and H&E sequential staining.

| Slide # |       Stain        | 
| ------- | ------------------ |
|    1    | only wright giemmsa|
|    2    | sequential polyT/dapi -> abeta/tau antibody -> H&E |

|    4    | sequential polyT/dapi -> H&E |

For slides # 2 - 4: (completeed on June 13, 2022)

*Complete steps 1-4 vertically in a glass coplin staining dish, then the rest horizontally in a humid chamber*
1. Obtain poly-lysine derivatized cover slips from Anthony/Jina (Cai lab). Bring coverslip to room temperature, section tissue, and mount on coverslips.
2. Place slide in 4% PFA in 1X PBS at room temperature for 10 minutes.
3. Wash slide twice with 1X PBS for 1 minute each.
4. Wash slide in 70% EtOH at room temperature for 30 minutes. Remove from ethanol and air dry.
5. Permeabilize in 8% SDS in PBS at room temperature for 30 minutes. Complete this step lying flat with 1 mL on slide in humid chamber. 
6. Remove SDS with pipette. 
7. Dip slide gently in 70% EtOH for 2 - 3 times, then air dry. *Note: do this gently otherwise the tissue section might come off the slide*
8. Rehydrate with 1 mL 2X SSC lying flat for 5 minutes at room temperature. 
9. Remove 2X SSC  add 100 uL of probe solution. 
10. Incubate with probe solution for 22.5 minutes.
11. Remove probe solution then add 10% wash buffer for 7.5 minutes at room temperature. 
12. Remove wash buffer and rinse with 2X SSC. 
13. Remove 2X SSC then incubate in 2X SSC + 1:1000 DAPI for 1 minute.
14. Remove DAPI then wash with 2X SSC twice.
15. Add equilibration buffer 300 uL for 2 minutes then drain.
16. Mount in 50 uL slo-fade anti-bleaching solution.
17. Cover with coverslip and seal with nail polish. 
18. Let nail polish dry and image.

For slides # 2 (**sequential polyT/dapi -> abeta/tau antibody -> H&E**): 
1. After the polyT/dapi hybridization is complete, remove the coverslip by submerging the slide in 95% EtOH to remove nail polish and gently remove thee coverslip. 
2. Rehydrate slide by taking it through 70% EtOH then dH20 after removing from 95% EtOH. Submerge in each for 3 mins.
3. Submerge slides in wash buffer (1X PBS with 0.1% NGS)
4. Apply True Black treatment to the slide. Dilute 20X TrueBlack® to 1X in 70% ethanol. For example, add 50 uL 20X TrueBlack® to 1 mL 70% ethanol. Vortex to mix well. Prepare 100-200 uL of 1X TrueBlack® for each tissue section to be treated.
5. Remove slides from the wash buffer. Tap slides to remove excess wash buffer and carefully wick away as much excess buffer as possible from around the sections using a Kimwipe®. **Note:** Do not allow sections to dry out, because this could affect the quality of fluorescence staining. It’s okay to leave a small amount of buffer on the section.
7. Place slides on a level surface (for example, in a humidified slide chamber used for antibody incubations). Quickly apply a generous amount of 1X TrueBlack® in 70% ethanol to completely cover the tissue sections (100-200 uL per section). **Note:** Perform TrueBlack® treatment on a small number of slides at a time to make sure the sections do not dry out during handling.
8. Leave the 1X TrueBlack® solution on the sections for 30 seconds. Longer incubation times of a few minutes are fine as long as sections don’t dry out.
9. Transfer the slides to a staining jar and rinse three times with PBS.
10. 1h 5% NGS blocking
11. Overnight 1st Ab dilution in 5% NGS
12. 3X 5 min 0,1% NGS washes
13. 1h 2 nd Ab dilution (1:500) in 0,1% NGS
14. 3X 5' PBS washes (add DAPI during the second wash)
15. Mounting with SlowFade™ Gold Antifade Mountant.

For slide #1 and #3 (wright giemmsa stain):
1. Section fresh frozen brain tissue at 40 microns; collect the section(s) on a SuperFrost Plus slide at room temperature. Set aside on the bench to dry; inspect the section visually to insure that it is no longer wet before proceeding. Sections can sit for hours (even days) at room temperature while drying.
2. Perform all following steps in the fume hood (chloroform and xylene are hazards).
3. Immerse slide in chloroform:100% Etoh 5 minutes at room temperature (or overnight also works).
4. Immerse slide in 100% Etoh 3 minutes at room temperature
5. Immerse slide in 95% Etoh 3 minutes at room temperature
6. Stain in Wright-Giemsa stain (full strength) for 30 seconds (I use a dropper and hold the slide over a tray).
7. Immerse slide in UltraPure H2O and move it around to rinse (brief).
8. Dip slide in 70% Etoh for 1 minute, while moving the slide up and down.
9. Dip slide in 95% Etoh for 1 minute, while moving the slide up and down.
10. Dip slide in fresh 100% Etoh 3-4X (brief)
11. Dip slide in fresh 100% Etoh 3-4X (brief)
12. Immerse slide in xylene bath #1 – 5 minutes
13. Immerse slide in xylene bath #2 – 5 minutes
14. Remove slide from xylene bath #2, drain, and place face up on a fresh paper towel. Add 3 drops permount and mount under coverslip. Let dry to harden before inspecting on microscope.
