# 2022-05-16 sequential polyT/dapi hybridization of post-mortem human DLPFC tissue

## Purpose
This experiment used a protocol to 

## Materials
Slide: 4781406, slice #1 cut on ?/22 and stored in freezer overnight, DLPFC post-mortem brain slice 
Slide: 4781406, slice #4 cut on ?/22 and stored in freezer for x days, DLPFC post-mortem brain slice 

## Notes and Observations
4781406, slice #1 was damaged during coverslip removal after polyT hybridization. 

## Summary of Results


## Experimental Protocol

1. Delipidize sections overnight in 1:1 100% EtOH:CHCl3
2. Place slide for 3 mins in 95% EtOH, 3 mins in 70% EtOH, and 3 min in dH20. 
3. Apply adequate Hematoxylin, Mayer’s (Lillie’s Modification) to completely cover 
tissue section and incubate for 5 mins.
4. Rinse slide in two changes of distilled water (1 min each) to remove excess stain.
5. Apply adequate Bluing Reagent to completely cover tissue section and incubate for
15 secs.
6. Rinse slide in two changes of distilled water (1 min each).
7. Dip slide in absolute alcohol and blot excess off.
8. Apply adequate Eosin Y Solution (Modified Alcoholic) to completely cover tissue
section to excess and incubate for 2-3 mins.
9. Rinse slide using absolute alcohol (quick).
10. Dehydrate slide in three changes of absolute alcohol (3 min each).
11. Clear slide with two changes in xylene (5 min each).
12. Blot excess and mount in synthetic resin
