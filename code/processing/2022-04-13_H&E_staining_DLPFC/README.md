# 2022-04-13 H&E Staining of post-mortem human DLPFC tissue

## Purpose
This experiment used an H&E Stain Kit to obtain histology of post-mortem human DLPFC tissue. The hematoxylin produces blue nuclei, contrasting the Eosin stained cytoplasm.

Staining Interpretation:
- Cytoplasm: Light pink
- Collagen: Pink
- Muscle: Pink/Rose
- Erythrocytes: Pink/Red
- Nuclei: Blue


## Materials

| **Item** | **Storage temp (before prep)** | **Storage temp (after prep)** |
| :--: |:--:| :--:|
| Hematoxylin, Mayer's (Lillie's Modification)| RT | RT|
| Eosin Y Solution (Modified Alcoholic)| RT | RT|
| Bluing Reagent| RT | RT |

Reagents 1 and 2 obtained from: ab245880 </br>
Reagents datasheet: https://www.abcam.com/he-staining-kit-hematoxylin-and-eosin-ab245880.html </br>

Scott's Alkaline Blueing was made by combining 500 mL water, 1 g sodium bicarbonate, and 10 g MgSO4. </br>

Slide: E8947111, cut on 4/12/22 to dry overnight, DLPFC post-mortem brain slice 

## Notes and Observations
The reagents were several years old and we suspected that they might not work.

## Summary of Results
We did not see the expected staining results - the nuclei were not stained blue as expected, but were a faint brown.

## Experimental Protocol

1. Delipidize sections overnight in 1:1 100% EtOH:CHCl3
2. Place slide for 3 mins in 95% EtOH, 3 mins in 70% EtOH, and 3 min in dH20. 
3. Apply adequate Hematoxylin, Mayer’s (Lillie’s Modification) to completely cover 
tissue section and incubate for 5 mins.
4. Rinse slide in two changes of distilled water (1 min each) to remove excess stain.
5. Apply adequate Bluing Reagent to completely cover tissue section and incubate for
15 secs.
6. Rinse slide in two changes of distilled water (1 min each).
7. Dip slide in absolute alcohol and blot excess off.
8. Apply adequate Eosin Y Solution (Modified Alcoholic) to completely cover tissue
section to excess and incubate for 2-3 mins.
9. Rinse slide using absolute alcohol (quick).
10. Dehydrate slide in three changes of absolute alcohol (3 min each).
11. Clear slide with two changes in xylene (5 min each).
12. Blot excess and mount in synthetic resin
