# 2022-04-13 H&E Staining of post-mortem human DLPFC tissue

## Purpose
This experiment used an H&E Stain Kit to obtain histology of post-mortem human DLPFC tissue. The hematoxylin produces blue nuclei, contrasting the Eosin stained cytoplasm. This experiment was a practice run, so only one slide was used.

Staining Interpretation:
- Cytoplasm: Light pink
- Collagen: Pink
- Muscle: Pink/Rose
- Erythrocytes: Pink/Red
- Nuclei: Blue


## Materials

| **Item** | **Storage temp (before prep)** | **Storage temp (after prep)** |
| :--: |:--:| :--:|
| Hematoxylin, Mayer's (Lillie's Modification)| RT | RT|
| Eosin Y Solution (Modified Alcoholic)| RT | RT|
| Bluing Reagent| RT | RT |

Reagents 1 and 2 obtained from: ab245880 </br>
Reagents datasheet: https://www.abcam.com/he-staining-kit-hematoxylin-and-eosin-ab245880.html </br>

Scott's Alkaline Blueing was made by combining 500 mL water, 1 g sodium bicarbonate, and 10 g MgSO4. </br>

Slide: E8947111, cut on 4/12/22 to dry overnight, DLPFC post-mortem brain slice. Tissue was sectioned by Brian using a cryostat into 30 um slices and left to dry on slides overnight.

## Notes and Observations
The reagents were several years old and we suspected that they might not work.

## Summary of Results
We did not see the expected staining results - the nuclei were not stained blue as expected, but were a faint brown. The majority of the tissue was stained a light pink. Areas stained with a lighter shade of pink corresponded to the white matter due to higher myelination. Darker pink was the grey matter.

## Experimental Protocol

Staining: 
1. Delipidize sections overnight in 1:1 100% EtOH:CHCl3
2. Place slide for 3 mins in 95% EtOH, 3 mins in 70% EtOH, and 3 min in dH20. 
3. Apply adequate Hematoxylin, Mayer’s (Lillie’s Modification) to completely cover 
tissue section and incubate for 5 mins.
4. Rinse slide in two changes of distilled water (1 min each) to remove excess stain.
5. Apply adequate Bluing Reagent to completely cover tissue section and incubate for
15 secs.
6. Rinse slide in two changes of distilled water (1 min each).
7. Dip slide in absolute alcohol and blot excess off.
8. Apply adequate Eosin Y Solution (Modified Alcoholic) to completely cover tissue
section to excess and incubate for 2-3 mins.
9. Rinse slide using absolute alcohol (quick).
10. Dehydrate slide in three changes of absolute alcohol (3 min each).
11. Clear slide with two changes in xylene (5 min each).
12. Blot excess and mount in synthetic resin

Imaging: 
Slide was imaged using Zeiss light microscope __(insert scope name)__ under bright field.
