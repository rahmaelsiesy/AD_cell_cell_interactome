# Protocol for Hematoxylin & Eosin, Luxol fast blue and thioflavin-s stains

## PURPOSE:  
Most cells are transparent and appear almost colorless when unstained. Histochemical stains are therefore used to provide contrast to tissue sections making tissue structures more visible and easier to evaluate.  The routine stain used universally as a starting point in providing essential structural information is the hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stain. With this method cell nuclei are stained blue and cytoplasm and many extra-cellular components in shades of pink. However sometimes additional information is required to provide a full differential diagnosis and this requires further, more specialized staining techniques. These may be “special stains”, two of which are Luxol Fast Blue and Thioflavin-S.
Following staining procedures, a cover slip is mounted over the tissue specimen on the slide to help protect and inhibit the fading or yellowing of stained specimens.
 
## DEPARAFFINIZATION:  
Before proceeding with the staining protocol for Hematoxylin & Eosin (H&E), Luxol Fast Blue (LFB) and Thioflavin-S (Thio) the slides must be deparaffinized and rehydrated.  Incomplete removal of paraffin can lead to poor staining of the section.
 
### MATERIALS AND REAGENTS: 
•	Xylene Reagent Grade ACS
•	Absolute Ethyl Alcohol
•	95 percent Ethyl Alcohol
•	Eight (8) stainless steel and glass staining dishes with inside dimensions of 4.3” x 3.35” x 2.95” and able to contain approximately 300ml.  Covers should have appropriate lab label indicating reagent affixed to the top Stainless-steel staining racks each one to accommodate 20-24 unstained slides with detachable handles.
•	Timer
 
### METHOD:
1.	 Prior to commencing deparaffinization procedure make sure protective clothing, lab gown, mask, protective eyewear and gloves, are worn.  Steps for deparaffinization will be executed under the histopathology laboratory fume hood.
2.	Place stainless steel and glass staining dishes in a row under the fume hood and fill as follows:  dishes 1 thru 3 with Xylene, dish 4 with absolute alcohol, dishes 5 and 6 with absolute alcohol, dishes 7 and 8 with 95 percent alcohol.  Make sure that lids are placed on dishes.
3.	Place the slides horizontally in a metal staining rack that can accommodate up to 24 slides and attach the rack handle.  Starting with staining dish number 1 submerge the rack into the Xylene.  Cover with stainless steel staining dish top and set timer to five (5) minutes.  Repeat this same procedure two more times consecutively – staining dishes 2 and 3 for five (5) minutes each.
4.	Rinse slide rack in staining dish number 4, absolute alcohol, dipping a total of 10 times.
5.	Place slide rack in staining dishes number 5 and 6, absolute alcohol, for five (5) minutes each.
6.	Continue by placing rack in staining dishes number 7 and 8, 95 percent alcohol, for five (5) minutes each.
7.	When deparaffinization is completed and slides have been washed in the above sequence, place slides in cold running tap water for 5 minutes to thoroughly rinse off alcohol.  Make sure to keep slides in the water until ready to perform either H&E, LFB or Thio staining.  At no point should slides be allowed to dry.

### STAINING PROCEDURE:
1.	Prior to commencing H&E staining procedure make sure protective clothing, lab gown, mask, protective eyewear and gloves, are worn.
2.	Once deparaffinization has been completed and slides have been thoroughly rinsed of alcohol, the staining procedure for H&E can begin.  Place the hematoxylin glass staining dish, the 0.5 percent acid alcohol glass staining dish, the ammonium hydroxide with tap water staining dish and COLD distilled water staining dish on the counter top right by sink.
3.	Remove stainless steel slide rack from glass staining dish in sink and drain well by tilting rack to one side and then the other before placing in hematoxylin stain
4.	Place in hematoxylin stain for 9 minutes. SET TIMER!
5.	Remove from hematoxylin and rinse in running tap water until clear, 3-5 minutes.  While rinsing make sure to keep discarding water yet keeping slides wet until water is clear.
6.	Remove slide rack from water, drain and DIP QUICKLY  2-3 times in the acid alcohol.
7.	Transfer slide rack to COLD DISTILLED WATER in glass staining dish on counter and dip a couple of times before transferring to large staining dish in sink to continue rinsing in COLD running tap water.  Keep rinsing in water 2 times.  Change to lukewarm water when draining slides to place in ammonium hydroxide.
8.	QUICK DIPS 3-5 times in ammonium hydroxide and then rinse in lukewarm running tap water 3 – 4 minutes discarding water until clear.
9.	Drain slides and go under fume hood and ONE QUICK DIP in 95 percent alcohol and then only 9 SECONDS IN EOSIN Y STAIN.  MAKE SURE TO SET TIMER FOR 9 SECONDS.
10.	Continue with ten (10) dips in 95 percent alcohol two (2) separate times, ten (10) dips in absolute alcohol two (2) separate times and ten (10) dips in xylene two (2) separate times.  Slides can be left in the last Xylene staining dish until mounting with cover slips can be done.
11.	When mounting make sure to wipe excess Xylene off  IN BACK OF SLIDE NOT FRONT with Kimwipe.  DO NOT WIPE SLIDE IN FRONT OR WILL RUIN TISSUE SPECIMEN.
12.	Quickly place a small amount of Cytoseal mounting medium along slide edge horizontally and holding cover slip width wise carefully lower on slide to cover tissue specimen.
13.	Remove any bubbles from under cover slip by gently pressing on cove rslip with a cotton swab and helping move bubble to the closest edge. Gently wipe away any excess mounting medium. Place on slide holder and allow to dry thoroughly. Label slide with case number, date, type of stain, block number.
